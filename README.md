# CB external controller for PLL with ESP32
Third part of my recent CB projects.

Around 1980 I designed an external scanner for CB radio, I always wanted to design another one with modern technology which I did for the Super Panther and several other radios.
I recently bought a Rystl CB-4082, the same model I had in the good old days,  and I wanted to do something different, the radio works as a normal radio until I switch on the external controller.

It is intended for the old Cybernet chassis radios but could be used for others. Have a look at the Super Panther video for more info.

The speech processor repository has the link to the video. Same disclaimer applies and as for adding extra channels "for educational purposes only".

Some features:

3.5” touch screen with channel and frequency display.

Extended channels from 0..40 to -40..+80 or what the radio’s RF circuits can handle.

Direct entry channel or frequency.

Channel presets.

S-meter and TX power meter.

Adjustable TX power.

Scanning with lockout and S history graph.

WiFi and webserver to change the channels remotely.
